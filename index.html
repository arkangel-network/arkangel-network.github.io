    Welcome to arkangel.network. We are a third party labeling service for bluesky. We label rightwing users using advanced scripting with human in the loop systems to ensure false positives are kept to a minimum.
    <br>
    Our labeling criteria is as follows. 
     <br>
    Anyone right of center is labeled as rightwing, by the determination of the mods running the labeler. 
     <br>
    This includes the terf movement and the "red/brown" alliance types who claim to be on the left but launder far right talking points.
     <br>
  These groups advocate positions that advance the cause of the global far right, and are thus included despite any personal ideological identification.
     <br>
    Removal: To get removed for a false positive, subscribe to the labeler and report yourself, select other and put in "appeal" and the reasons why you believe its a false positive.
     <br>
    To get removed due to a genuine ideological change you have had, we must see a disavowal of past behaviors and a change in them as well. If you feel you have changed, also report yourself to the labeler and ask for a review.
