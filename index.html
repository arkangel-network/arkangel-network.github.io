    <p>Welcome to Arkangel Network. We are a third-party labeling service for BlueSky. Our mission is to identify and label right-wing users using advanced scripting combined with human oversight to minimize false positives.</p>

    <h2>Our Labeling Criteria</h2>
    <p>We label individuals who are determined by our moderators to be right of center. This includes movements such as the trans-exclusionary radical feminist (TERF) movement and members of the "red/brown" alliance who may identify as left-wing but promote far-right ideologies.</p>

    <p>These groups advocate positions that align with the objectives of the global far right. Therefore, they are included in our labeling regardless of their personal ideological identifications.</p>

    <h2>Removal Process</h2>
    <p><strong>For False Positives:</strong> If you believe you have been labeled incorrectly, please subscribe to the labeler and report your account. Select "Other" and include "Appeal" along with the reasons why you believe it is a false positive.</p>

    <p><strong>For Ideological Changes:</strong> To be removed due to a genuine change in ideology, we require evidence of a disavowal of past behaviors and a demonstrable change in conduct. If you feel you have evolved in your views, please report your account for a review.</p>
